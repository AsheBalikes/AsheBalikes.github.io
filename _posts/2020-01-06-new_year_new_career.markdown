So I've hit a bit of a road block. I am more behind than I wanted due to you know holidays and being the only one working for the last couple weeks. Maybe starting in December wasn't the smartest idea....oh well. I also was glitched for some reason. While I had my school loan, I was kicked out of Learn.Co for a little over a week now. But it's okay I'm back!

I think I'm going to refresh on all that i've learned so far and then hit in even harder. Honestly, github and the learn system for entering stuff seems more complicated than everything else I've learned regarding HTML/CSS/Ruby. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing but I know I'll learn more as I go. Frankly, I'm excited not to just learn from Flatiron, but also to learn from 3rd party sites and people...which is something I didn't utilize enough in design until later.

I plan to go to the campus just to meet people and network, brainstorm, and help fuel my learning experience. I've got a good start going so far this year (not just in my learning experience) so I feel very ambitious and motivated. Now that all the snags are out of the way, I can dive in again. 

I know this wasn't a well written blog or super detailed. After I hit my next lesson, I'll make a new updated blog post. I just wanted to touch base on where I'm at in my own progress and journey, where I'm going next and my plan to make it happen. First thing is first though, refresher and teaming up with people on a similar path.
