I remember the exact moment I discovered my life's calling. I was 12, drawing at the table, watching tv and nothing particularly interesting was happening. I had a very vague understanding of the art and design fields but was told once that my illustrative skills would be good in graphic design. So, in the midst of drawing some videogame character, on a whim, it was decided.

Following your passion, despite money or security is the American dream and one I was determined to have. I flirted with fields like forensics, medical, and psych but always remained loyal to design. As I got to college, the difference in my hobby and what I'd actually be doing set in...and my love affair began to fade. Not with a bang or a sudden shock, but with the creeping feeling that I had rose tinted glasses on this entire time. I was a naive kid when I was forced to pick and by the time I realized it was not for me, it was too late.

But as I sat in my design courses, with friends in programming, I often admired them. Their field was blossoming, it felt prestigious and intelligent but out of reach for me. Despite having amazing grades and ambition, I felt I didn't have the mindset for programming of any sort. The irony of that mindset was that it was perfect for me all along. I had spent the vast majority of my preteen and teen years on the computer, shut away working on projects or games that required creative thinking, constant learning, and tedious work. Computers have always been my life, and while I had been interested in java, html, or css, I never applied my personality to it.

For you see, I came to realize that having a creative mind doesn't necessarily make you an artist--but it can be molded into a plethora of resources that I had yet to discover. As I grew and found myself in dead end job after dead end job within the customer service field, being completely under valued, I knew I had to get out. So the journey began.

What would be ideal for me? I didn't want a fairy tale love story with my career, I wanted what all older people in relationships wanted--Security. Growth. Financial stability. A content love affair. 

Psychology, medical, forensics, accounting, finance...I dove through every career. Googling, figuring out how I could possibly go back to school while looking for work, watching youtube videos. Yet, what convinced me was my friends who had been there the whole time. You see, I'm an active person on a social platform called Discord, where a good number of my friends are in some kind of computer science field. I asked around and from there, I learned everything I could about the different paths. 

Everyone wanted to shove me back in the box I had been struggling to get out of. I was told ux/ui were definitely the path for me and for a while, I believed that. However, it didn't take long for the creeping sensation of dread set back in. No, the overly creative careers were just meant to be hobbies. All of the other paths looked incredible to me, though, but I knew it wouldn't be easy to get there. I figured web dev was really the place I could be creative, continiously learning, problem solving, testing, and putting my more logical/pattern oriented side to work. 

I wish I had seen it all along. I was only seeing one part of my own puzzle, and I had completely failed to see not just what would make me happy in the moment, but the long run. Art was my first love, but I was a child and I didn't understand the gravity of those words. I do now.
